        <h4>About</h4>

        <p>
            This is an experimental project that represents Taipei Metro system using a force directed
            diagram. It allows the selection and display of planned routes, train prediction and, the very approximate
            location of predicted trains within the network.
        </p>
        <h4>Usage</h4>

        <p>
            Click on Metro stations to display or reset planned routes. Once selected, train predication data will be
            displayed
        </p>
        <h4>General</h4>

        <p>
            This project has been developed (almost) entirely with HTML SVG elements and the D3.js Javascript library.
            It uses features that may only be available in advanced browsers and has been tested with latest versions of
            Safari and Chrome.
